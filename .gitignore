# Add any directories, files, or patterns you don't want to be tracked by version control
#ignore emacs backup and lock files:
*~
\#*\#
.\#*

#Also needed for vi:
.*.sw?

#ignore any build output and user files:
/install/
/.bld/
/.system/depfix/bld/

#Extra protection against adding in build output created by custom user commands:
*.so
*.dylib
*.o
*.a
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.exe
*.gch
*.out
__pycache__/

#latex build leftovers:
*.aux
*.blg
*.bbl
*.dvi
#NB: The .log filter is appropriate for latex, but not for others like dgcode:
*.log
*.spl
*.bak
*.toc

#Miscellaneous:
.DS_Store
vgcore.*
